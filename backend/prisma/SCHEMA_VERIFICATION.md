# Prisma Schema Verification Checklist

> **A historical record, not a current picture.** This captures the schema
> verification done for the v1.0.0 release on 10 February 2026, against a
> statement of work that is not in this repository. The schema has grown a lot
> since: **20 models and 9 enums today**, against the 10 and 7 recorded below.
>
> Models added since and *not* covered here: `PasswordResetToken`,
> `CampaignInvitation`, `CharacterTemplate`, `CreatureTemplate`,
> `CreatureFavorite`, `TokenTemplate`, `SystemSettings`, `PersonalNote`,
> `DiceMacro`, `CampaignDocument`.
>
> Treat `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` as the source of truth. Kept because the
> field-level and relationship checks below still describe the original models
> accurately and are useful when changing them.

### Campaign Relationships (9 total)
- ✅ owner → User (@relation "CampaignOwner")
- ✅ currentMap → Map? (@relation "CurrentMap")
- ✅ memberships → CampaignMembership[]
- ✅ maps → Map[] (@relation "CampaignMaps")
- ✅ characters → Character[]
- ✅ messages → Message[]
- ✅ diceRolls → DiceRoll[]

## Testing Recommendations

Before proceeding to next phase:

```bash
# Verify schema syntax
npx prisma validate

# Generate Prisma Client (should complete without errors)
npx prisma generate

# Format schema
npx prisma format
```
