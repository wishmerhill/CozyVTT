## Middleware Cheat Sheet

### Import Statement
```typescript
import { authenticated, adminOnly, campaignMember, campaignDM, campaignDMOrPlayer } from '../middleware/compose';
import { AuthenticatedRequest } from '../middleware/rbac';
```

### Route Protection Patterns

#### 1. Authenticated User Only
```typescript
router.get('/api/profile', authenticated, handler);
```

#### 2. Admin Only
```typescript
router.get('/api/admin/users', adminOnly, handler);
```

#### 3. Campaign Member (Any Role)
```typescript
router.get('/api/campaigns/:campaignId', campaignMember, handler);
// Access: req.campaignMembership.role, req.campaignMembership.characterIds
```

#### 4. Campaign DM Only
```typescript
router.put('/api/campaigns/:campaignId/settings', campaignDM, handler);
```

#### 5. Campaign DM or Player (Excludes Spectators)
```typescript
router.post('/api/campaigns/:campaignId/chat', campaignDMOrPlayer, handler);
```

## Permission Helper Functions

### Import Statement
```typescript
import {
  canEditCharacter,
  canMoveToken,
  canManageMaps,
  canToggleSpiritLayer,
  canDeleteCampaign,
  // ... other helpers
} from '../services/permissions';
```

### Common Patterns

#### Check Character Edit Permission
```typescript
const hasPermission = await canEditCharacter(
  userId,
  characterId,
  campaignId,
  platformRole
);

if (!hasPermission) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
}
```

#### Check Token Movement Permission
```typescript
const canMove = await canMoveToken(userId, characterId, campaignId);

if (!canMove) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Cannot move this token' });
}
```

#### Which token fields a player may change

`PUT /api/campaigns/:campaignId/maps/:id/tokens/:tokenId` is mounted on
`campaignMember`, so the route guard alone does **not** decide this. A player who
controls the token may change only where it is and how it looks in play:

| A player controlling the token may set | Everything else is DM-only |
|---|---|
| `position`, `rotation`, `size`, `conditions` | `hp`, `showHpBar`, `notes`, `initiative`, `type`, `disposition`, `visible`, `name`, `imageUrl`, `layer`, `controlledBy`, `displayMode`, `statBlock`, `creatureTemplateId`, `metadata` |

The DM-only list is `restrictedFields` in `routes/maps.ts`. **Adding a token field
means adding it there too** unless a player is meant to write it — the list is
deny-based, so a new field is player-writable by default. That is how `metadata`
came to be writable by any campaign member: it was added to the token shape and
never added to the list.

#### Check Campaign Deletion Permission
```typescript
const canDelete = await canDeleteCampaign(userId, campaignId, platformRole);

if (!canDelete) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Only owner or admin can delete' });
}
```

---

## Request Type for TypeScript

### AuthenticatedRequest
```typescript
import { Response } from 'express';
import { AuthenticatedRequest } from '../middleware/rbac';

router.get('/:campaignId', campaignMember, async (req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response) => {
  // Type-safe access
  const userId = req.session.userId!;
  const role = req.campaignMembership!.role;
  const characterIds = req.campaignMembership!.characterIds;
  const campaignId = req.campaignMembership!.campaignId;
});
```

---

## Response Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 401 | Unauthorized | User not logged in |
| 403 | Forbidden | User logged in but lacks permission |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid input data |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Unexpected error |

---

## Common Middleware Combinations

### Pattern 1: Simple Authenticated Route
```typescript
router.get('/api/resource', authenticated, handler);
```

### Pattern 2: Admin-Only Route
```typescript
router.delete('/api/admin/resource', adminOnly, handler);
```

### Pattern 3: Campaign Member Route
```typescript
router.get('/api/campaigns/:campaignId/data', campaignMember, handler);
```

### Pattern 4: DM-Only Campaign Route
```typescript
router.put('/api/campaigns/:campaignId/maps', campaignDM, handler);
```

### Pattern 5: Complex Permission Check
```typescript
router.put('/api/characters/:characterId', authenticated, async (req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response) => {
  const userId = req.session.userId!;
  const platformRole = req.session.platformRole!;
  const { characterId } = req.params;
  const { campaignId } = req.body;

  const hasPermission = await canEditCharacter(userId, characterId, campaignId, platformRole);

  if (!hasPermission) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
  }

  // ... proceed with update
});
```

## Per-user permission flags

Four booleans on `User` gate things the role system does not. None is carried in
the session, so each is read from the database at the point of use — do not
assume `req.session` knows about them.

| Flag | Default | What it gates |
|---|---|---|
| `globalAssetManager` | `false` | Uploading or managing GLOBAL-scope assets. Checked in `routes/assets.ts` alongside `platformRole === 'ADMIN'`; either is sufficient. |
| `templateEditor` | `false` | Publishing, editing and deleting shared character sheets (`/api/character-templates`). Checked in `routes/characterTemplates.ts`; platform ADMIN also passes. |
| `mustChangePassword` | `false` | When true, **every** endpoint returns 403 with `code: PASSWORD_CHANGE_REQUIRED` except `POST /api/auth/change-password`, `POST /api/auth/logout`, `GET /api/auth/me`, `GET /api/auth/ping`, `GET /api/auth/appearance` and `GET /api/config`. WebSocket connections are refused on the same basis. Set when an admin creates an account or resets a password. |
| `isApproved` | `true` | Sign-in. An unapproved account authenticates but is refused at `routes/auth.ts`. New registrations are created unapproved when the instance requires approval. |

## Reading an asset: access follows use

The five asset-serving routes (`/api/assets/maps/:id`, `/tokens/:id`,
`/documents/:id`, `/audio/:id`, `/avatars/:userId`) decide read access from the
asset's **scope**. `GLOBAL` is readable by anyone signed in, `CAMPAIGN` by that
campaign's members, and `USER` by its uploader.

Scope alone is not enough for maps and tokens, because an asset can be *used*
somewhere its scope does not describe. A DM picking a map out of their own
library — which the picker offers, listing personal assets with no campaign
filter — leaves every player at that table 403ing on the battlemap. So
`routes/assets.ts` funnels the two image routes, the document route and
`/:id/download` through one `canReadAssetFile`, which is `canReadAsset` in
`services/permissions.ts`. Beyond scope it asks two more questions:
`assetUsedInUserCampaign(assetId, userId)`, true when a map layer, a token
placed on a map, a character, a creature template or a token template in one
of the caller's campaigns points at that asset; and `documentSharedWithUser`,
true when a DM has linked the document to a campaign the caller belongs to
(`CampaignDocument`). The linking route runs the same `canReadAsset` against
the DM first, so a link can only ever grant what the DM could already read,
and then requires the document to be the DM's own or `GLOBAL`, so a document
shared into one campaign cannot be passed on by a member who runs another.

Three things this deliberately does **not** do:

- **It does not re-scope the asset.** `Asset.scope` carries a single
  `campaignId`, and one map is commonly shared by several campaigns at once, so
  promoting it on use would break the others.
- **It grants read only.** Deleting and editing are decided by their own routes
  and are unchanged — seeing the battlemap must not mean being able to delete it.
- **It does not cover audio or avatars.** Those have their own reference paths
  and were left alone. The audio route is a hand copy of the scope half of the
  rule and carries a `TODO(permissions)`; atmosphere audio picked from a DM's
  personal library is the case it gets wrong.

### Documents

Documents are assets of type `DOCUMENT`, so everything above applies, plus:

- **Where one may be placed is one decision.** `canPlaceAssetAtScope(userId,
  type, scope, campaignId)` answers for both the multipart upload and
  `POST /api/assets/documents`: `GLOBAL` needs a platform admin or
  `globalAssetManager`, `CAMPAIGN` needs that campaign's DM, `USER` needs
  nothing. It returns `{ allowed, status, message }` so both routes refuse
  with the same wording.
- **Editing is the uploader's or an admin's.** `PUT /documents/:id/content`
  checks `uploadedById` against the session, not `canReadAsset`; being able to
  read a shared rulebook must not mean being able to rewrite it for the table.
- **Sharing and unsharing are the DM's** (`campaignDM` on the link routes),
  and sharing is limited to the DM's own documents and global ones. A DM may
  read a document shared with a table they play at; they may not re-share it.
  Unlinking revokes read for the whole campaign at once.
- **Refusals are `404`, not `403`**, on the serving, edit and link routes, so
  no reply confirms that a private id exists.

Two things to get right when adding a check of this kind:

- **Read the flag, do not trust the session.** `templateEditor` and
  `globalAssetManager` are deliberately not session fields, so a permission
  change takes effect immediately rather than after the next sign-in.
- **Branch on `code`, not on the message.** The password-change gate answers with
  a machine-readable `code`; clients route on that, and changing the wording must
  not change behaviour.

## Campaign Membership Data

After using `campaignMember`, `campaignDM`, or `campaignDMOrPlayer` middleware:

```typescript
req.campaignMembership = {
  role: 'DM' | 'PLAYER' | 'SPECTATOR',
  characterIds: string[],
  campaignId: string
}
```

---

## Ownership is not the DM role

Two separate facts, and they are only the same person by default:

| Fact | Where it lives | Moves? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Campaign owner | `Campaign.ownerId` | No — a DM transfer leaves it alone |
| DM | `CampaignMembership.role === 'DM'` | Yes — see below |

Decide **"is this user the DM?"** from the membership, never from `ownerId`.
Reading ownership works right up until the seat moves, and then it refuses the
actual DM and keeps privileges with someone who no longer runs the game. In
socket handlers that means `socket.role`; in routes, `req.campaignMembership`
or the `campaignDM` middleware.

`ownerId` gates exactly one thing — deleting the campaign (`canDeleteCampaign`),
which is deliberate: the destructive power stays with whoever created it.

### Transferring the DM role

`PUT /api/campaigns/:campaignId/dm` with `{ userId }` promotes a member and
demotes the sitting DM in one transaction, so the one-DM rule is never caught
half-applied. Allowed for the sitting DM, the campaign owner, or a platform
admin — `canTransferDM` in `services/permissions.ts`.

It does **not** use the `campaignDM` middleware, which loads the caller's
membership first and refuses a non-member, shutting out an admin who is not at
the table.

The generic role route still refuses to touch a DM or mint a second one. That is
intentional: transferring is the only supported way to move the seat, so there is
one atomic path rather than two.

### Roles change under open sockets

`socket.role` is read once, when the socket authenticates, and trusted by every
gated handler after that. A transfer therefore has to update live connections or
the outgoing DM keeps DM powers until they reload — use
`applyRoleToLiveSockets(userId, campaignId, role)` from `websocket/utils.ts`.
REST needs no equivalent; its middleware reads the membership per request.

## Error Response Format

```typescript
// 401 Unauthorized
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "You must be logged in to access this resource"
}

// 403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "You do not have permission to access this resource"
}

// 404 Not Found
{
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "Campaign not found"
}
```

## Testing Checklist

When implementing a new protected route:

- ✅ Test with no authentication (should return 401)
- ✅ Test with wrong role (should return 403)
- ✅ Test with correct role (should succeed)
- ✅ Test with Admin role (should succeed if Admin override applies)
- ✅ Test with non-member (should return 403)
- ✅ Test with campaign member but wrong role (should return 403)

## Common Gotchas

### 1. Middleware Order Matters
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - loadCampaignMembership runs after requireAuth
router.get('/', authenticated, loadCampaignMembership, requireDM, handler);

// ❌ WRONG - loadCampaignMembership runs before auth check
router.get('/', loadCampaignMembership, requireAuth, requireDM, handler);
```

### 2. Use Composed Middleware
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use pre-composed middleware
router.get('/', campaignDM, handler);

// ❌ VERBOSE - Manual composition (works but verbose)
router.get('/', requireAuth, loadCampaignMembership, requireDM, handler);
```

### 3. Campaign ID Location
```typescript
// campaignId can come from:
req.params.campaignId  // URL parameter
req.body.campaignId    // Request body

// loadCampaignMembership checks both locations
```

### 4. TypeScript Types
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use AuthenticatedRequest
router.get('/', campaignMember, async (req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response) => {
  const role = req.campaignMembership!.role;  // TypeScript knows this exists
});

// ❌ WRONG - Using generic Request
router.get('/', campaignMember, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const role = req.campaignMembership.role;  // TypeScript error!
});
```

**Quick Summary:**
1. Use `authenticated` for routes requiring login
2. Use `adminOnly` for admin-only routes
3. Use `campaignMember`, `campaignDM`, or `campaignDMOrPlayer` for campaign routes
4. Use permission helpers (`canEdit*`, `canManage*`, etc.) for complex logic
5. Always check permissions server-side, never trust client
6. Use `AuthenticatedRequest` type for TypeScript autocomplete
