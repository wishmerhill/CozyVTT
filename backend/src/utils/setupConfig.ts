/**
 * The setup wizard's system configuration step.
 *
 * The wizard asks for an instance name, a timezone, and whether public
 * registration is allowed. It validated the name and showed all three back on
 * its review screen, but none of them were sent and `POST /api/setup/init` read
 * only the admin's credentials — so every instance came up with the defaults
 * regardless. An admin who deliberately enabled registration got it disabled,
 * and nothing said so.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function rather than inline in the route so it can be tested
 * without a database. Reaching the state the route needs — no settings row, no
 * users — means emptying tables the rest of the suite is using at the same
 * time, which is not a trade worth making for logic that is really just
 * "read three optional fields the same way the admin settings page does".
