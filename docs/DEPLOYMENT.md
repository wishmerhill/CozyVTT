# CozyVTT — Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying CozyVTT to a **production server** using Docker Compose (recommended) or manually. The default `docker compose up -d --build` command in this guide runs the **hardened production stack**: compiled binaries, Nginx reverse proxy, no exposed database/backend ports.

> 🛠️ **Just want to hack on the code locally?** You're in the wrong file. See **[DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)** for the dev setup (hot reload, exposed ports, source-mounted volumes).

## Requirements

- A Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)
- Docker 24+ and Docker Compose v2
- A domain name pointing to your server's IP (optional for LAN-only use)
- At least 1 GB RAM; 2 GB recommended for comfortable operation

---

## Docker Compose Deployment

This is the recommended path. `docker-compose.yml` is the production stack: PostgreSQL, the compiled backend, the React frontend served by Nginx, and an Nginx reverse proxy that handles all public traffic.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CheekyChinchilla/CozyVTT.git
cd CozyVTT
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in all required values. At minimum:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_PASSWORD=choose-a-strong-password-here

# Security — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
SESSION_SECRET=your-64-char-random-string

# Your public URL (used for CORS and email links)
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com

NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Build and start the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This starts four containers on an isolated internal network:
- `cozyvtt-database` — PostgreSQL 15 (internal only, not exposed to host)
- `cozyvtt-backend` — Express API on internal port 4000
- `cozyvtt-frontend` — React SPA served by Nginx on internal port 80
- `cozyvtt-nginx` — Reverse proxy, the only container with public ports (80 and 443)

Database migrations run automatically when the backend starts.

### 4. Complete the setup wizard

Navigate to `http://your-server` (or `http://localhost` if testing locally) and complete the setup wizard to create your admin account.

### 5. Verify the stack

```bash
# Check all containers are healthy
docker compose ps

# Confirm migrations ran
docker compose logs backend | grep -i migrat

# Health check (returns {"status":"healthy",...})
docker compose exec backend wget -qO- http://localhost:4000/health

# The API answers on the same address as the site — this must be JSON, not a web page
curl -si http://localhost/api/setup/status | head -3
```

That last check should show `content-type: application/json` followed by something like
`{"setupCompleted":false,"hasUsers":false,"needsSetup":true}`. If it shows `content-type: text/html`,
your `/api` requests are landing on the web pages instead of the API — see
[Using an External Reverse Proxy](#using-an-external-reverse-proxy).

### Stopping and Starting

```bash
docker compose stop          # Stop without removing containers
docker compose start         # Start stopped containers
docker compose restart       # Restart all services
docker compose down          # Stop and remove containers (data volume preserved)
docker compose down -v       # ⚠️ Also removes volumes — deletes all database data
```

---

## Port Configuration

By default, the Nginx container binds to host ports **80** (HTTP) and **443** (HTTPS). If those ports are already in use, set `HTTP_PORT` and/or `HTTPS_PORT` in your `.env`:

```env
# Access CozyVTT at http://yourserver:8080
HTTP_PORT=8080
HTTPS_PORT=8443
```

The defaults (`80`/`443`) apply if these variables are not set.

---

## Using an External Reverse Proxy

If you already run a reverse proxy (Traefik, Caddy, another Nginx, or a Cloudflare Tunnel), you don't need the bundled `nginx` service.

### First, the one thing that trips everyone up

CozyVTT runs as three pieces: a **frontend** (the web pages you see), a **backend** (the API and live game connection), and a **database**. Your browser talks to both the frontend and the backend, on the same web address:

| Web address | Must reach |
|---|---|
| `/api/...` | the **backend** |
| `/socket.io/...` | the **backend** (this is the live connection — dice rolls, token movement, chat) |
| everything else | the **frontend** |

The bundled `nginx` service is what normally does that splitting. **If you remove it, your own proxy has to do all three lines above.**

There's a second catch. Out of the box, the backend and frontend use `expose`, which means *"other containers can reach me"* — **not** *"the outside world can reach me."* The bundled nginx is the only piece with `ports`, which is what actually opens a port on your server. So when you delete the nginx service, you also have to open ports on the backend and frontend yourself, or your proxy will be pointing at nothing.

> **If you miss this:** the site loads and looks fine, but the setup wizard never appears (you get a login page you can't use), or setup fails with **502**. That's the API being unreachable — the pages come from the frontend, which is still working.

### Option A — Remove the nginx service (most common)

1. **Delete the `nginx` service block** from `docker-compose.yml` (the whole `nginx:` section).

2. **Open ports on the backend and frontend.** In `docker-compose.yml`, replace the `expose` block in each service with `ports`:

   ```yaml
     backend:
       # ...
       ports:
         - "127.0.0.1:4000:4000"     # was: expose: - "4000"

     frontend:
       # ...
       ports:
         - "127.0.0.1:8080:80"       # was: expose: - "80"
   ```

   Read `"127.0.0.1:8080:80"` as: *port 80 inside the container becomes port 8080 on this server, reachable only from this server itself.*

   > 🔒 **Keep the `127.0.0.1:` prefix.** Without it (`"4000:4000"`), your API is published on your server's public IP over plain, unencrypted HTTP — anyone who finds it bypasses your proxy entirely, along with any protection it provides. The `CORS_ORIGIN` setting does **not** protect against this; it only restricts browsers, not tools like `curl`.
   >
   > A firewall is not a substitute here: **Docker's published ports bypass UFW**, so a rule like `ufw deny 4000` usually does *not* block a port published this way. The `127.0.0.1:` prefix is the reliable control.

3. **Point your proxy at those ports:**

   | Requests for | Send to |
   |---|---|
   | `/api/...` | `http://localhost:4000` |
   | `/socket.io/...` | `http://localhost:4000` |
   | everything else | `http://localhost:8080` |

4. **Restart and check it worked:**

   ```bash
   docker compose down     # also stops the old nginx container
   docker compose up -d
   curl -si https://your-domain.com/api/setup/status | head -3
   ```

   Use `down` first: deleting the `nginx` block from the file does **not** stop a container that is already running, and a leftover nginx still holding port 80 will confuse things. Your database is stored in a volume and is not affected by `down` (only `down -v` would erase it).

   You should see `content-type: application/json` and a line like `{"setupCompleted":false,...}`. If you see `content-type: text/html`, your proxy is sending `/api` to the frontend instead of the backend. If you see `502`, nothing is listening where your proxy is pointing — usually step 2 was skipped.

### Option B — Shared Docker network (recommended for Traefik/Caddy)

If your proxy also runs in Docker, this is cleaner: it talks to the containers directly by name, and **no ports need to be opened at all**.

1. Remove the `nginx` service block from `docker-compose.yml`
2. Add your proxy's network to both `frontend` and `backend` services:
   ```yaml
   networks:
     - internal
     - proxy     # your external proxy's network name
   ```
3. Declare it as external at the bottom:
   ```yaml
   networks:
     internal:
       driver: bridge
     proxy:
       external: true
   ```
4. Configure your proxy to route to `frontend:80` and `backend:4000` by container name — same three routing lines from the table above.

### Cloudflare Tunnel

`cloudflared` makes an outbound connection to Cloudflare, so no inbound ports need to be open on your server's firewall. There are three ways to set it up — pick one:

**1. Keep the bundled nginx (simplest, recommended).** Leave `docker-compose.yml` exactly as shipped and point the tunnel at it. One rule, nothing to open, and nginx handles the `/api` vs `/socket.io` vs frontend split for you:

```yaml
# ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
ingress:
  - hostname: cozyvtt.example.com
    service: http://localhost:80        # or your HTTP_PORT
  - service: http_status:404
```

This is also the option that keeps upload limits (`NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE`) and secure-cookie headers working without extra configuration.

**2. Run `cloudflared` as a container** on CozyVTT's own Docker network. Nothing is published to the host at all — the tunnel reaches the containers by name:

```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: cozyvtt.example.com
    path: ^/api/
    service: http://backend:4000
  - hostname: cozyvtt.example.com
    path: ^/socket.io/
    service: http://backend:4000
  - hostname: cozyvtt.example.com
    service: http://frontend:80
  - service: http_status:404
```

> ⚠️ Inside a container, `localhost` means *that container itself*, not your server. Use the service names (`backend`, `frontend`) as above — `http://localhost:4000` will fail here.

**3. `cloudflared` installed on the server** (not in Docker), with the ports from Option A step 2 opened:

```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: cozyvtt.example.com
    path: ^/api/
    service: http://localhost:4000
  - hostname: cozyvtt.example.com
    path: ^/socket.io/
    service: http://localhost:4000
  - hostname: cozyvtt.example.com        # catch-all — must be LAST
    service: http://localhost:8080
  - service: http_status:404
```

**Rule order matters.** Cloudflare reads ingress rules top to bottom and uses the **first** one that matches. A rule with only a `hostname` matches *everything* for that domain, so if you put it above the `path` rules, it swallows `/api` and `/socket.io` — and you get the "login page instead of setup wizard" symptom. Always list the specific `path` rules first and the catch-all last.

`path: ^/api/` is a pattern meaning *"any address starting with `/api/`"*. Keep it exactly as written.

After editing `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`, restart the tunnel and re-run the check from Option A step 4:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared
curl -si https://cozyvtt.example.com/api/setup/status | head -3
```

### Minimum proxy requirements

Whatever proxy you use, it must:
- Forward `/api/*` and `/socket.io/*` to the backend, and everything else to the frontend
- Support WebSocket upgrades (`Upgrade: websocket` / `Connection: upgrade`) on the `/socket.io/` path
- Pass `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers to the backend
- Allow request bodies of at least **55 MB** (covers the default `MAX_MAP_SIZE_MB=50` plus overhead), and more if you raise any `MAX_*_SIZE_MB` — see [Upload Size Limits](#upload-size-limits)

> ⚠️ **A proxy that only serves the web pages looks like it works.** If `/api` isn't routed to the backend, those requests come back as the CozyVTT web page itself with a success code, so the site loads normally while every API call quietly fails. Symptoms: a brand-new install shows the login page instead of the setup wizard, and `/setup` bounces straight back to the home page. The `curl` check above tells you in one command.

> ⚠️ **Cloudflare users:** Cloudflare-proxied requests — including Cloudflare Tunnel — are capped at **100 MB** per request body on Free and Pro plans. Uploads above that are rejected at Cloudflare's edge no matter how CozyVTT or your proxy is configured.

### Updating after you've edited `docker-compose.yml`

Once you've changed `docker-compose.yml`, a plain `git pull` will stop and complain, because your changes and ours are both in that file:

```
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
        docker-compose.yml
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
```

Set your changes aside, update, then put them back:

```bash
git stash          # tuck your edits away
git pull           # get the update
git stash pop      # re-apply your edits
```

If `git stash pop` reports a conflict, the file will contain both versions marked with `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` lines — open it, keep the lines you want, delete the markers, then `docker compose up -d --build`.

> ⚠️ **Don't "fix" this with `git checkout -- docker-compose.yml`.** That throws your customizations away and restores the shipped file — you'd lose your ports, your proxy setup, everything you changed.

### Optional: avoid the conflicts entirely (advanced)

If you update often and would rather never deal with the above, Docker Compose can read a **second, personal file** that sits on top of the shipped one. Name it `docker-compose.override.yml` and put it next to `docker-compose.yml`; `docker compose up -d` picks it up automatically, and CozyVTT's `.gitignore` already excludes it, so `git pull` will never touch it.

Copy the ready-made example to get started:

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
```

It contains only the settings you're changing — **not** a copy of the whole file:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    profiles: ["disabled"]              # keeps nginx from starting
  backend:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:4000:4000"
  frontend:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:80"
```

Two things to know:

- **Adding settings works naturally.** The `ports` lines above are simply added to the shipped configuration. You leave `docker-compose.yml` untouched, so it updates cleanly forever.
- **Removing a service doesn't.** There's no way to delete something in this second file — it can only add or change. The `profiles: ["disabled"]` line above is the workaround: it tags the nginx service so it never starts. (If you'd rather not use that, you can leave the line out and start CozyVTT with `docker compose up -d database backend frontend`, naming the services you want — but you have to remember it every time.)

Check that it did what you expect, then restart:

```bash
docker compose config --services   # lists what will run — nginx should be absent
docker compose config              # shows the full merged configuration

docker compose down                # stops the currently-running nginx
docker compose up -d
```

`down` is needed the first time because an nginx container that is already running keeps running until it is stopped — the profile only controls what *starts*.

> One catch: this automatic pickup only happens when you run plain `docker compose` commands. If you pass `-f` yourself, list both files: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d`.

### Can I run CozyVTT in a folder, like `example.com/cozyvtt/`?

Not at the moment. Give CozyVTT its own web address instead — `cozyvtt.example.com`, or `example.com` itself.

**Why:** the addresses of your maps and token pictures are saved starting with a `/`, which means "the top of this website". Put CozyVTT in a folder and those addresses point one level too high, so none of the pictures load. Changing the *domain* is free for the same reason — the domain was never part of the saved address — which is why moving from one hostname to another just works.

**What to do instead:** add a DNS record for `cozyvtt.example.com` pointing at your server, then match on that hostname rather than a path. In Traefik that means a `Host()` rule instead of `PathPrefix()`:

```yaml
# instead of:  PathPrefix(`/cozyvtt`)
- "traefik.http.routers.cozyvtt.rule=Host(`cozyvtt.example.com`)"
```

It takes about five minutes, and it is the setup CozyVTT is built and tested for.

Running in a folder is on the backlog rather than ruled out. If it matters to you, say so on the issue tracker — how many people need it is what decides whether it gets built.

## SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt

> ℹ️ **Not validated by the maintainer.** The maintainer's reference deployment uses [Cloudflare Tunnel](#cloudflare-tunnel-recommended-for-public-instances) (easier, better security, free, hides your origin IP), so this Let's Encrypt path has not been part of the maintainer's own deployment testing. The instructions below are accurate to the bundled Nginx config and should work, but community confirmation and contributions are very welcome — if you successfully deploy CozyVTT with Let's Encrypt, please open an issue or PR with any tweaks you needed.
>
> Use this path if you have a reason to avoid Cloudflare (data residency, paranoia about edge TLS termination, regional access issues, or just personal preference) — those are all legitimate.

### Prerequisites

- A domain name pointing at your server
- Ports 80 and 443 open in your firewall (the default configuration)

### Obtain a certificate

```bash
# Install Certbot
sudo apt-get install -y certbot

# Stop the nginx container temporarily so Certbot can bind port 80
docker compose stop nginx
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
docker compose start nginx
```

Certificates are placed at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/`.

### Configure Nginx to use the certificate

1. Copy the certs into `nginx/certs/`:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem nginx/certs/server.crt
   sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem nginx/certs/server.key
   sudo chown $(whoami) nginx/certs/*
   ```

2. In `nginx/nginx.conf`, uncomment the HTTPS server block and the HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect.

3. Restart Nginx:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart nginx
   ```

### Automate certificate renewal

Certbot installs a systemd timer. Test it:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

After each renewal, re-copy the updated certs and restart Nginx. Add to cron:

```bash
# Weekly, Monday at 3 AM
0 3 * * 1 \
  cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem /path/to/cozyvtt/nginx/certs/server.crt && \
  cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem /path/to/cozyvtt/nginx/certs/server.key && \
  docker compose -f /path/to/cozyvtt/docker-compose.yml restart nginx
```

---

## Manual Deployment

If you prefer to manage the processes yourself (systemd, pm2, etc.) without Docker:

### 1. Install Node.js 20

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### 2. Install PostgreSQL 15

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-15
sudo -u postgres createdb cozyvtt
sudo -u postgres createuser cozyvtt
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER cozyvtt WITH PASSWORD 'your-db-password';"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cozyvtt TO cozyvtt;"
```

### 3. Configure and build

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET, NODE_ENV=production
npm install
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run build

# Frontend (empty VITE_API_URL = relative URLs, routed by your Nginx)
cd ../frontend
npm install
VITE_API_URL="" VITE_SOCKET_URL="" npm run build
# Output: frontend/dist/
```

### 4. Run the backend with pm2

```bash
npm install -g pm2
cd backend
pm2 start dist/server.js --name cozyvtt-backend
pm2 save
pm2 startup  # Follow the printed instructions to enable autostart
```

### 5. Serve with Nginx

Create `/etc/nginx/sites-available/cozyvtt`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;
    add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin always;

    # Must be >= the largest MAX_*_SIZE_MB in .env, plus a few MB of overhead
    client_max_body_size 55M;

    # API → backend
    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:4000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # WebSocket → backend
    location /socket.io/ {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:4000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade           $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection        "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
    }

    # Frontend static files (SPA)
    location / {
        root  /path/to/cozyvtt/frontend/dist;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/cozyvtt /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

## Environment Configuration

### Generating Secrets

```bash
# Generates a SESSION_SECRET. Run once and paste into .env.
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### SMTP Setup (Optional)

Email is required for password resets and invitations. Configure in `.env`:

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=noreply@your-domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password
SMTP_FROM="CozyVTT <noreply@your-domain.com>"
SMTP_SECURE=false   # true for port 465 (TLS), false for port 587 (STARTTLS)
APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

Test from **Admin Dashboard → Settings → Test Email** after deploying.

#### What SMTP unlocks

| Feature | With SMTP | Without SMTP |
|---|---|---|
| **Adding a user** | **Invite User** — they get an email with a link and choose their own password. Nobody else ever sees it. | **Create User** — a temporary password is generated and shown to you once, to hand over yourself |
| Password resets (self-service) | User clicks "Forgot password" and gets a reset link | Unavailable — the user has to ask an admin |
| Password resets (admin) | Email the user a reset link, or generate a temporary password | Generate a temporary password from the Users tab |
| Campaign invitations | Appear on the player's dashboard. The DM may *optionally* tick a box to email them as well | Appear on the player's dashboard; the email option is disabled and says why |

**Campaign invitations do not depend on SMTP.** A DM invites someone who already has an account, and the invitation shows up on that player's dashboard for them to accept — no link is involved and nothing needs to be shared by hand. As of 1.2.2 the accompanying email is opt-in per invitation and off by default, so a campaign runs perfectly well on an instance with no mail server. This is the opposite of the *account* invitations in the row above, which are an email or nothing.

Either way, an account created by an admin **must set its own password on first sign-in** — the
temporary password works for nothing else, so an admin never keeps usable access to someone's
account. Invitation links are valid for **7 days**; use **Invite** on the Users tab to send a fresh
one if it expires.

### Upload Size Limits

```env
MAX_MAP_SIZE_MB=50
MAX_TOKEN_SIZE_MB=5
MAX_AUDIO_SIZE_MB=20
MAX_AVATAR_SIZE_MB=2
MAX_DOCUMENT_SIZE_MB=50

# Request body cap for the bundled Nginx — must be >= the largest limit above
# plus ~5 MB of multipart overhead
NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE=55M
```

These take effect on `docker compose up -d` (no image rebuild needed): the backend enforces them, and the app fetches them at runtime for the admin panel and the upload dialog. Values that aren't a positive number are ignored, with a warning in the backend log.

`MAX_DOCUMENT_SIZE_MB` covers the PDF, text and Markdown files in the document library. Core rulebooks often run past 50 MB; if your group's do, raise this one and `NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE` together.

**If you raise a limit, raise the proxy limit too.** A file larger than the proxy's body cap is rejected with an HTTP 413 before it ever reaches CozyVTT:

| Setup | What to change |
|---|---|
| Bundled Nginx (default `docker-compose.yml`) | Set `NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE` in `.env`, then `docker compose up -d` |
| Your own Nginx | `client_max_body_size` in your server block |
| Traefik | `buffering.maxRequestBodyBytes` middleware (defaults to unlimited) |
| Caddy | `request_body { max_size ... }` |
| Cloudflare proxy / Tunnel | Hard 100 MB cap on Free/Pro — not configurable |

The backend logs its effective limits at startup and warns when they exceed the configured proxy cap:

```
Upload limits: MAP 50MB, TOKEN 5MB, AUDIO 250MB, AVATAR 2MB, DOCUMENT 50MB
NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE=55M is smaller than the largest upload limit AUDIO (250 MB). ...
```

The admin panel shows the same numbers under **Settings → Upload Size Limits**, along with the body size your proxy needs.

## File Storage

Uploaded files are stored at `backend/uploads/`. In the Docker setup this directory is bind-mounted from the host, so files survive container restarts and image rebuilds.

Back up `backend/uploads/` alongside your database dumps. See [Database Backups](#database-backups) below.

For large or multi-server deployments, consider mounting an S3-compatible object store (MinIO, AWS S3) as a FUSE filesystem at `backend/uploads/`. No code changes required.

---

## Per-User Permissions

Beyond the platform role (Admin / User), two permissions are granted individually from **Admin Dashboard → Users**, as pill toggles beside each user's role. Both default to off, including on upgrade, and neither appears for admins, who have both implicitly.

| Permission | Grants |
|---|---|
| **Global Assets** | Upload, re-scope and delete instance-wide assets that every user can see |
| **Templates** | Edit or delete anyone's character template, not just their own — for curating what users have published |

Grant these sparingly: both write content visible to every user on the instance. Revoking either takes effect on the user's next request; they do not need to sign out.

---

## Database Backups

### Via Admin Dashboard

**Admin Dashboard → Backups → Create Backup** generates a compressed `pg_dump` file you can download for offsite storage.

### Via the included scripts

Run these from the folder you installed CozyVTT into, with the stack running:

```bash
# Create a backup — written to ./backups/cozyvtt_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz
./backend/scripts/backup.sh

# Restore one (this REPLACES the current database — it asks you to confirm)
./backend/scripts/restore.sh ./backups/cozyvtt_20260101_030000.sql.gz
```

Both notice that you are running under Docker and do the work inside the
database container, so you do **not** need PostgreSQL installed on the host.
Backups older than 30 days are pruned; set `BACKUP_RETAIN_DAYS` to change that.

If you run CozyVTT without Docker, give them a `DATABASE_URL` instead:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/cozyvtt" ./backend/scripts/backup.sh
```

### Via Command Line

The same thing by hand, if you would rather not use the scripts:

```bash
# Create a backup
docker compose exec database \
  pg_dump -U cozyvtt cozyvtt | gzip > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql.gz

# Restore from a backup
gunzip -c backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz | \
  docker compose exec -T database psql -U cozyvtt cozyvtt
```

### Automated Daily Backups (cron)

```bash
crontab -e

# Daily at 3 AM, keep 30 days of history
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/cozyvtt && \
  docker compose exec -T database pg_dump -U cozyvtt cozyvtt \
  | gzip > /backups/cozyvtt_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql.gz && \
  find /backups -name "cozyvtt_*.sql.gz" -mtime +30 -delete
```

## Monitoring and Logs

### Container Logs

```bash
# Follow all containers
docker compose logs -f

# Backend only
docker compose logs -f backend

# Filter for errors
docker compose logs backend | grep -i error
```

### Persistent Log Files

The backend writes structured JSON logs to `backend/logs/` on the host:

- `backend/logs/combined.log` — all log levels
- `backend/logs/error.log` — errors only

### Health Check Endpoint

```
GET /health
```

Returns `200 OK` when healthy:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "services": { "api": "ok", "database": "ok" }
}
```

Returns `503` with `"status": "degraded"` if the database is unreachable. Useful for uptime monitors and load balancer health probes.

This endpoint lives on the **backend**, which the bundled Nginx does not forward — so on a default install, check it from inside the stack:

```bash
docker compose exec backend wget -qO- http://localhost:4000/health
```

Docker already runs this check for you every 30 seconds; `docker compose ps` shows the backend as `healthy` or `unhealthy` based on it.

If you run your own reverse proxy and want an uptime monitor to reach `/health` from outside, add a route for it alongside your `/api` route, both pointing at the backend.

### Database Connectivity

```bash
docker compose exec database pg_isready -U cozyvtt
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### A brand-new install shows the login page instead of the setup wizard

…and going to `/setup` sends you straight back to the home page.

**Cause:** your `/api` requests aren't reaching the backend, so the app can't tell that this is a new installation. Almost always a reverse-proxy routing problem, not a CozyVTT problem.

**Check it:**

```bash
curl -si https://your-domain.com/api/setup/status | head -3
```

| What you see | What it means | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `content-type: application/json` | The API is fine — the problem is elsewhere | Check `docker compose logs backend` |
| `content-type: text/html` | `/api` is being answered by the web pages instead of the backend | Add the `/api/...` → backend route to your proxy |
| `502` or a connection error | Nothing is listening where your proxy points | Open the backend port — see [Option A](#option-a--remove-the-nginx-service-most-common) step 2 |

### Setup fails with "An error occurred during setup" (502)

Same root cause as above: the browser reached the wizard (served by the frontend), but the request that creates your admin account goes to the backend, which your proxy can't reach. Run the same check.

If you removed the bundled `nginx` service, the usual culprit is a missing `ports` entry on the **backend** service — it is `expose`-only by default, which means "reachable from other containers" but not from your proxy.

### Live features don't work (dice, token movement, chat)

The page loads and you can log in, but nothing updates in real time. Your proxy is routing `/api` but not `/socket.io`. Add the `/socket.io/...` → backend route, and make sure your proxy allows WebSocket upgrades.

### `git pull` refuses to update because of local changes

```
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge
```

You edited a tracked file (usually `docker-compose.yml`). See [Updating after you've edited `docker-compose.yml`](#updating-after-youve-edited-docker-composeyml).

### Uploads fail on large files

Check [Upload Size Limits](#upload-size-limits). The backend logs its effective limits at startup and warns when your proxy's body limit is smaller than they are:

```bash
docker compose logs backend | grep -i "upload limits"
```

---

## Updating CozyVTT

```bash
git pull origin main

# Rebuild images and restart
docker compose up -d --build

# Confirm migrations ran
docker compose logs backend | grep -i migrat
```

Database migrations run automatically via `prisma migrate deploy` on every startup. Downtime is typically under 30 seconds while containers restart.

> **Back up before you upgrade.** See [Database Backups](#database-backups) — one `pg_dump` command, and back up `backend/uploads/` alongside it.

### One-off data migration for this release

If you have **Pathfinder 2e** characters made from the built-in templates, run
this once after upgrading so their strikes and class features appear on the
sheet. It also tidies up D&D 5e sheets, whose features already display without
it.

```bash
# See what would change, without writing anything
docker compose exec backend npm run migrate:sheet-fields -- --dry-run

# Apply
docker compose exec backend npm run migrate:sheet-fields
```

Running it twice is harmless. Details in
[backend/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md](../backend/DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md).

### Without Docker

```bash
git pull origin main

cd backend
npm install
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run build
pm2 restart cozyvtt-backend

cd ../frontend
npm install
VITE_API_URL="" VITE_SOCKET_URL="" npm run build
# Static files in frontend/dist/ are now updated — Nginx serves them immediately
```

## Hardening Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] **Strong secret** — `SESSION_SECRET` is a 32+ character random string, not the placeholder value from `.env.example`
- [ ] **HTTPS only** — SSL certificate installed; HTTP block in `nginx/nginx.conf` redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] **Firewall** — Only ports 80 and 443 (or your configured `HTTP_PORT`/`HTTPS_PORT`) are publicly reachable; backend (4000) and database (5432) are not exposed to the internet
- [ ] **CORS_ORIGIN** — Set to your specific domain, not a wildcard
- [ ] **Registration** — `allowRegistration` is **off** for private instances. You choose this in the setup wizard, and can change it later in **Admin → Settings**
- [ ] **Admin MFA** — Admin account has MFA enabled
- [ ] **Backups tested** — Automated backups configured and a restore drill completed successfully
- [ ] **Upload isolation** — `backend/uploads/` is served only through authenticated backend endpoints, not directly by the web server
- [ ] **Security headers** — HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options are set in the Nginx HTTPS block
- [ ] **Database isolation** — PostgreSQL container uses `expose` (not `ports`); unreachable from outside the Docker network
- [ ] **Log rotation** — `backend/logs/` directory is being rotated (consider `logrotate` for the host-mounted path)
- [ ] **OS updates** — A plan exists for keeping the host OS and Docker up to date
- [ ] **Brute-force protection** — `fail2ban` (or equivalent) is configured to block IPs hammering `/api/auth/login` and SSH; CozyVTT's own auth limiter is 5 req/15min on auth routes, but a host-level ban catches scanners earlier
- [ ] **Stable update plan** — You watch the [CozyVTT repo](https://github.com/CheekyChinchilla/CozyVTT) for releases and apply security patches promptly (no auto-update is bundled — that's your choice)
- [ ] **Vulnerability reporting path** — You've read [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) and know how to report issues responsibly
- [ ] **Origin hidden (optional but recommended)** — Instance is fronted by a Cloudflare Tunnel, Tailscale Funnel, or equivalent so the server's real IP is never exposed (see below)

---

## Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended for Public Instances)

If CozyVTT is reachable from the internet, fronting it with a **[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)** is the cheapest, lowest-effort way to harden the deployment. Tunnels are free for personal use and provide:

- **No open ports** — your VPS doesn't need 80/443 (or anything) reachable from the internet; the tunnel daemon makes an outbound connection to Cloudflare and accepts incoming traffic through that
- **Origin IP hidden** — attackers can't directly reach your server even if they know your domain
- **Automatic DDoS / bot protection** at the edge
- **Free TLS** without managing Let's Encrypt yourself
- **Optional Zero Trust gating** — require Google / GitHub / one-time-PIN auth before users can even reach the login page (great for private campaigns)

### Quick setup

1. Sign up at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and point your domain's nameservers at them.
2. Install `cloudflared` on the VPS:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
   sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
   ```
3. Authenticate the daemon to your Cloudflare account:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel login
   ```
4. Create a tunnel and point it at your local CozyVTT:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel create cozyvtt
   cloudflared tunnel route dns cozyvtt cozyvtt.example.com
   ```
5. Create `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   tunnel: <tunnel-id-from-step-4>
   credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<tunnel-id>.json

   ingress:
     - hostname: cozyvtt.example.com
       service: http://localhost:80   # or whatever HTTP_PORT you set
     - service: http_status:404
   ```
   > This single rule assumes you kept the bundled `nginx` service, which is the recommended setup — it splits `/api` and `/socket.io` off to the backend for you. **If you removed nginx**, one rule is not enough; you need path-based rules in a specific order, plus published ports. See [Cloudflare Tunnel](#cloudflare-tunnel) under "Using an External Reverse Proxy".
6. Run as a service:
   ```bash
   sudo cloudflared service install
   sudo systemctl start cloudflared
   ```
7. Confirm the API is reachable through the tunnel, not just the web pages:
   ```bash
   curl -si https://cozyvtt.example.com/api/setup/status | head -3
   ```
   You want `content-type: application/json`. Anything else means the tunnel isn't reaching the backend — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

Once running, you can **close ports 80 and 443 on your VPS firewall entirely** — only SSH (port 22, or your chosen alternative) needs to be reachable, and even that you can put behind Cloudflare Access if you want.

### When NOT to use a Cloudflare Tunnel

- You don't trust Cloudflare with TLS termination (they technically see decrypted traffic)
- You have strict data-residency requirements that conflict with Cloudflare's global edge
- You're running on LAN-only — no tunnel needed; just use the local IP or a Tailscale node

Alternatives in the same family: **Tailscale Funnel** (P2P, no third-party termination), **ngrok**, **inlets**, or running your own reverse proxy + WAF (more work, more control).

## Hosting the API Documentation

CozyVTT ships an OpenAPI 3.0 spec at [`backend/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.yaml`](../backend/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.yaml). It documents every endpoint with examples, error responses, and schemas. You have three reasonable options for what to do with it:

### Option A — Publish publicly (recommended for community instances)

Host the rendered Swagger UI / Redoc at a public URL like `/docs`. This is what every major API provider does (Stripe, GitHub, etc.) and is **not a security risk** — every endpoint requires authentication or proper RBAC, and obscuring routes is not a meaningful defense against automated scanners.

To render the docs to a static HTML page:

```bash
cd backend
npx @redocly/cli build-docs docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.yaml --output public/docs.html
```

Then serve `public/docs.html` from your Nginx config:

```nginx
location = /docs {
    alias /path/to/backend/public/docs.html;
    default_type text/html;
}
```

### Option B — Behind authentication

If you'd rather not advertise your instance's endpoints, serve the docs only to logged-in admins:

```nginx
location = /docs {
    auth_request /api/auth/me;
    alias /path/to/backend/public/docs.html;
}
```

This calls `/api/auth/me` on every docs request; non-authenticated users get a 401 redirect to login.

### Option C — Don't host them on the instance at all

Keep the spec in the repo and reference it from a separate docs site (e.g. `cozyvtt.com/docs`). Self-hosters who never need API access get a slightly smaller attack surface and a cleaner Nginx config.

### A note on enumeration

Whichever option you pick, do **not** rely on hiding the spec as a security measure. Real protection comes from:

- Per-endpoint authentication and RBAC checks (built in — see `backend/src/middleware/`)
- Rate limiting (sign-in 5 failures/15min, new accounts 10/hour, uploads 30/min, general API 300/min)
- Magic-byte file validation (not MIME header)
- Strong session secrets and Argon2id password hashing
- Helmet.js CSP headers in production

If those are in place, documenting the API is a feature, not a risk.
