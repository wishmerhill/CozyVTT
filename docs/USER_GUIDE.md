# CozyVTT User Guide

Welcome to CozyVTT — your cozy, self-hosted virtual tabletop for adventuring with friends. Whether you're rolling dice across a dungeon crawl or weaving stories through the astral plane, CozyVTT keeps everyone at the same table, no matter where they are.

This guide covers everything you need to get started, from the setup wizard to advanced session features.

## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup (Admin Only)

When you first navigate to your CozyVTT instance, you'll be greeted by the **Setup Wizard** — a short four-step process that configures the platform before anyone else can log in.

*Screenshot pending — Setup wizard welcome screen.*

**Step 1 — Welcome**
Read the brief intro and click **Next** to begin. The whole process takes about two minutes.

**Step 2 — Admin Account**
Create the administrator account. This is the most powerful account on the platform — keep these credentials safe!

- **Display Name** — What other users will see (2–50 characters)
- **Email** — Your login email address
- **Password** — Must be at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and at least one number
- A live password strength meter gives you instant feedback as you type

*Screenshot pending — Admin account creation form with password strength indicator.*

**Step 3 — System Configuration**
Give your instance its identity:

- **Instance Name** — Appears in browser tabs and the page title (e.g., "The Hearthstone Tavern")
- **Timezone** — Used for timestamps across the platform; you can auto-detect or pick from a list
- **Public Registration** — Choose whether new users can register themselves. For private groups, leave this **off** and create accounts manually from the Admin Panel

*Screenshot pending — System configuration step.*

**Step 4 — Review**
Double-check everything, then click **Complete Setup**. If anything looks wrong, use the **Back** button to correct it.

Once setup is complete, you'll be logged in as the administrator and taken to your dashboard.

---

### Logging In

Navigate to your CozyVTT URL and enter your email and password. If Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on your account, you'll be prompted for your authenticator code after entering your password.

*GIF pending — Login flow with MFA step.*

**Forgot your password?** If your instance has email configured, use **Forgot password** on the login page. Otherwise contact your platform administrator, who can email you a reset link or generate a temporary password from the Admin Panel.

**First time signing in?** An account someone else created for you always ends its first sign-in with you choosing your own password. Until you do, the temporary password you were given won't open anything else — so nobody, including the admin who created the account, keeps a way in.

---

### User Accounts

CozyVTT has two platform-level roles:

| Role | What they can do |
|------|-----------------|
| **Admin** | Manage the entire platform: users, settings, backups, and global assets |
| **User** | Create campaigns (as DM), join campaigns (as player), manage characters |

Your role badge is visible on your profile page.

---

## The Dashboard

After logging in, the **Dashboard** is your home base. From here you can see everything happening across your campaigns at a glance.

*Screenshot pending — Full dashboard view.*

### What's on the Dashboard

**Quick Stats** — A summary row showing how many campaigns you're running, how many you're playing in, and how many are currently active.

**Pending Invitations** — If a DM has invited you to a campaign, a banner appears here. You can accept (and choose which of your characters to bring) or decline.

*Screenshot pending — Pending invitation banner.*

**Your Campaigns** — A grid of campaign cards. Each card shows the campaign name, description, your role (DM or Player), and the current session status. Click any campaign card to jump right in.

*Screenshot pending — Campaign card grid with status indicators.*

**Quick Access** — Cards for your Character Library, Asset Library and Documents so you can navigate there in one click.

### Creating a New Campaign

Click the **+ New Campaign** button from the dashboard to open the campaign creation form.

*GIF pending — Creating a new campaign.*

Fill in:
- **Campaign Name** — Required. Keep it evocative!
- **Description** — Optional, but players will see this when they're invited
- **Game System** — What ruleset you'll be playing under

Click **Create Campaign** and you're in. You'll be taken straight to the campaign page.

---

## Campaign Management

### Campaign Page Overview

The campaign page is your command center during play. It's a three-column workspace designed for a desktop screen:

*Screenshot pending — Full campaign page layout with labeled panels.*

- **Left Sidebar** — Campaign info, party roster, and (for DMs) the token roster
- **Center Canvas** — The battle map where tokens live and adventures happen
- **Right Sidebar** — a tabbed panel with **Chat**, **Dice**, **Initiative**, and **Session** (vibe + session controls); a badge on the Chat tab shows unread messages while you're on another tab

You can **drag the dividers** between the columns to resize them, and collapse the side columns entirely to give the map more room. Your layout and last-used tab are remembered per browser. The **header bar** across the top contains navigation, connection status, and DM controls.

---

### Adding Maps

Maps are the battlegrounds, taverns, and dungeons your players will explore. Before a session, upload your map images to the **Asset Library** (see [The Asset Library](#the-asset-library)), then add them to your campaign.

As the DM, click the **Maps** button in the campaign header to open the Map Manager.

*Screenshot pending — Map Manager panel.*

From here you can:
- **Add a map** by selecting an uploaded image from your asset library
- **Switch to a different map** — this updates the view for all connected players immediately
- **Remove a map** from the campaign

*GIF pending — Switching the active map mid-session.*

### Managing Campaign Settings

Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the campaign header to open Campaign Settings. Here you can update the campaign name, description, and other properties.

### Managing Your Roster

Players join your campaign by accepting an invitation. Once they're in, they appear in the **Campaign Roster** on the left sidebar. You can see all current members and their characters.

To invite someone:
1. Go to **Campaign Settings**
2. Find the **Invite Players** section
3. Enter the email address of the user on your platform
4. They'll see a pending invitation on their dashboard

**Handing the campaign to someone else.** A campaign has one DM, and that seat
can be passed to another member — useful when you are handing off to a co-DM or
stepping back from a game that carries on without you. It does not change who
*owns* the campaign, so if you created it you can still delete it and can take
the seat back later. See
[Handing the game to someone else](DM_GUIDE.md#handing-the-game-to-someone-else).

---

### Tokens

Tokens represent characters, monsters, NPCs, and objects on the map.

**Placing tokens:** Open the **Token Manager** (Tokens button in the header) to add, configure, and manage all tokens in your campaign. DMs can also place tokens directly from the **Creature Library** (see [DM Guide](DM_GUIDE.md#the-creature-library)).

*Screenshot pending — Token Manager panel.*

Each token has:
- **Name** — Displayed on hover
- **Image** — Choose from your asset library (TOKEN type assets), or leave blank for a colored-letter placeholder
- **Type** — PC, NPC, or Object
- **HP** — Hit points that other players can see update in real time
- **Size** — How many grid squares the token occupies (default 1×1)
- **Display Mode** — **Pog** (circular), **Top-Down** (overhead art), or **Full-Art** (full rectangular image)
- **Disposition** — Hostile (red), Friendly (green), or Neutral (blue) — affects the placeholder color
- **Conditions** — Two-letter amber badges above the token for status effects (**PO**isoned, **ST**unned, and so on). Hover any token to read its conditions in full
- **Spirit Layer Visibility** — Whether the token appears in the spirit layer view
- **Stat Block** — NPC tokens can carry a stat block with AC, HP, speed, attacks, and abilities

**Colored-letter placeholders:** Tokens without an assigned image display a colored circle with the creature's first initial. The color reflects the token's disposition.

**Moving tokens:** During a session, drag tokens around the map. Everyone connected sees the movement as it happens.

*GIF pending — Dragging a token across the map.*

---

## Character Management

### Your Character Library

The **Characters** page (accessible from the top nav or dashboard) shows all the characters you own across every campaign and game system.

*Screenshot pending — Characters page grid view.*

From here you can:
- **Create a new character**
- **Click a character** to read its sheet — **Edit** is on the sheet when you want to change something
- **Edit** an existing character directly, skipping the reading step
- **Copy** a character (great for variants or backup sheets)
- **Export** a character to JSON (for backups or sharing)
- **Import** a character from a JSON file
- **Assign** a character to a campaign, or **unassign** them if they've hung up their boots
- **Delete** a character (with a confirmation prompt — we know how precious they are)

### Creating a Character

Click **+ New Character** to open the character creation dialog. Choose your **Game System** first — this determines which character sheet you'll fill out.

*Screenshot pending — New character dialog with game system selector.*

After choosing a system, you'll be taken to the **Character Editor**.

### The Character Editor

The Character Editor is where you fill in every detail about your character — stats, skills, equipment, backstory, the works. What you see here depends on your game system.

*Screenshot pending — Character editor with D&D 5e sheet open.*

Click **Save** to save your progress. A timestamp in the header shows when your character was last saved. If you try to leave with changes you haven't saved, you'll be asked to confirm first — that covers the back arrow and closing or reloading the browser tab. After a save, leaving is silent.

You can also **Export to JSON** from the editor header at any time to grab a backup copy.

### Character Templates

A template is a starter sheet somebody has already filled in and shared. If you're new to a system — or your DM has prepared something for you — starting from one saves you a blank page.

Open **Character Templates** from the dashboard. Every template on the instance is listed; filter by game system, search by name, or tick **Only mine** to see just your own.

**Using one.** Click **Use** on any template. That creates a character that belongs entirely to you — you can rename it and change anything you like, and the original template is untouched. Whoever published it has no control over your character.

**Publishing one.** There are four ways:

- **New Template** on the templates page, which starts from a blank sheet for the system you pick
- **Save as Template** in the character editor, which publishes the sheet you're looking at
- while creating a character, if you want to keep the character and share it at the same time
- **Import** on the templates page, which publishes a character JSON file as a template

Templates you publish are visible to everyone on your instance. You can edit or delete your own at any time.

**Importing from another instance.** The **Import** button accepts any character JSON — one you exported from this instance, one you wrote yourself, or one exported from a *different* CozyVTT server. That last case is the useful one: export a character from wherever you built it, bring the file to a new instance, and publish it there for that group to copy. Character exports and templates hold the same thing — a sheet plus a game system — so no conversion is involved. You'll see a preview before anything is published, and you can set the name and description at that point.

> **A note on template images.** A template's picture has to be a **global** asset, because everyone who can see the template needs to be able to load it — a personal asset would show as broken for everyone but you. If you don't have permission to upload global assets, pick an existing global one or leave the image blank.

> **Template editors.** Admins can grant a user the **template editor** permission, which lets them tidy up or correct anyone's template. Nobody has it by default. If someone edits a template you published, that's why.

### Assigning a Character to a Campaign

A character has to belong to a campaign before it shows up in that campaign's roster. There are two ways:

- **When you create it** — pick the campaign in the new character dialog. The character joins the roster straight away.
- **Afterwards** — click **Assign** on any character card on the Characters page and pick the campaign.

You can only choose a campaign you are already a member of.

*GIF pending — Assigning a character to a campaign.*

Once assigned, that character becomes available as a token in the campaign, and the DM can see them in the campaign roster.

#### Flexible System

Running a homebrew game or a system that doesn't have a dedicated sheet? The **Flexible** sheet is a customizable, free-form character sheet where you define your own fields and sections. Perfect for rules-light games, narrative systems, or anything in between.

*Screenshot pending — Flexible character sheet.*

## The Asset Library

The Asset Library is where all your campaign media lives — maps, token images, ambient audio, and avatar images.

*Screenshot pending — Asset Library grid view.*

### Asset Types

| Type | What it's for |
|------|--------------|
| **Map** | Battle maps, dungeon layouts, world maps |
| **Token** | Character portraits, monster icons, object images |
| **Audio** | Ambient soundscapes, background music |
| **Avatar** | Your personal profile picture |

Rulebooks and handouts are not here. They have their own **Documents** section, described below, so a PDF never sits among your map thumbnails.

### Uploading Assets

Click the **Upload** button to add a new asset. You'll choose:
- The file to upload
- A name for the asset
- The **scope** — where this asset lives:
  - **Personal** — Only you can see and use it
  - **Campaign** — Shared with everyone in a specific campaign
  - **Global** — Available platform-wide (Admin/Global Asset Manager only)
- Optional tags for easy filtering later

*GIF pending — Uploading a new map asset.*

### Finding Assets

Use the **search bar** to find assets by name or tag. Filter by scope (Global, Personal, Campaign), type (Maps, Tokens, Audio, Avatars), and sort by date or name. Click a tag chip to filter to just assets with that tag.

### Viewing and Managing Assets

Click any asset card to open its **detail panel** on the right. From there you can see full metadata, edit tags, or delete the asset.

*Screenshot pending — Asset detail panel.*

---

## Documents

Rulebooks, house rules, handouts: the things a table reads rather than looks at. **Documents** on your dashboard keeps them apart from maps and tokens, and lets you read them without leaving CozyVTT.

### What you can keep here

| Format | How it gets here | Editable later? |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **PDF** | Upload | No, it is a file; upload a new one to replace it |
| **Plain text** (`.txt`) | Upload, or **Write one** | Yes, by whoever uploaded or wrote it |
| **Markdown** (`.md`) | Upload, or **Write one** | Yes, by whoever uploaded or wrote it |

Markdown documents render headings, lists, emphasis, tables, task lists and links. A single press of Enter starts a new line, the way it does in a chat message, so notes read the way you typed them.

The size limit is set by whoever runs your instance; the default is 50 MB, enough for most rulebook PDFs. Written documents are limited to about 900 KB of text, which is a very long document, and anything bigger is a file to upload.

### Who can read a document

This is decided by where you put it when you upload or write it:

| Scope | Who can read it |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Personal** | You alone, until a DM shares it with a campaign (see below). |
| **Campaign** | Every member of that campaign, immediately. Only the campaign's DM can put a document here. |
| **Global** | Everyone on the instance. Only an administrator or a global asset manager can put a document here. |

A DM can share a Personal or Global document with their campaign from inside it, and stop sharing it later. Sharing does not copy the file; the campaign's members read the same document you have, and if you edit it they see the new text next time they open it.

### Reading

Click a document's name or its **Read** button to open it in a full-screen reader over whatever page you are on. **Open in a new tab** does what it says, for reading on a second screen while play continues. A PDF is shown by your browser's own PDF viewer.

### Editing

Open a text or Markdown document you uploaded or wrote and press **Edit**. What you type is saved exactly as typed. If a save is refused, your text stays in the box and the reason is shown.

### Safety

Uploads are checked rather than trusted. A PDF must really be a PDF, and a text or Markdown file must really be text; a program renamed to `.md` is refused. Documents are always shown as text or as a PDF, never as a web page, so a file that contains HTML or a script is displayed as-is and nothing in it can run. There is no need to avoid typing `<` or `>` in a document; they show as typed.

Pictures in a Markdown document or note only load from your own CozyVTT. An image that points at another website would make every reader's browser contact that site, revealing who opened the document; instead its description is shown and nothing is fetched. To show a picture, upload it to your asset library and link to it from there.

---

## Running Sessions

This section is primarily for players during an active session. For DM-specific features, see the [DM Guide](DM_GUIDE.md).

### Joining a Session

Navigate to your campaign from the dashboard and connect to the session. If the DM has started a session, you'll see a live status indicator in the header.

*GIF pending — Connecting to an active session.*

The campaign page automatically reconnects if you lose your internet connection briefly — your position is restored when you come back.

### The Chat Panel

The **Chat** panel on the right sidebar is how everyone communicates during a session.

*Screenshot pending — Chat panel with example messages.*

Type your message in the input field and press **Enter** to send. Messages show your display name and a timestamp. System messages (like session start/stop events) appear in a different style.

### Rolling Dice

The **Dice Roller** is right below chat. Click a die face to roll it, or type a custom expression.

*GIF pending — Rolling dice and seeing the result in the Dice panel.*

**Saving a roll you use often.** Press **Saved** below the dice buttons to keep a
named roll — a house rule, a homebrew subsystem, `4d6kh3` for rolling up a
character. It becomes a one-click button beside the dice. Saved rolls are private
to you and belong to the one campaign, and the same button is where you rename,
edit or delete them. See the
[Player Guide](PLAYER_GUIDE.md#the-dice-roller) for the full description.

**Supported dice notation:**
- `d20` — Roll a single d20
- `2d6` — Roll two d6s and sum them
- `4d6kh3` — Roll four d6s and keep the highest three (great for ability score generation!)
- `1d20+5` — Roll a d20 and add 5
- `2d6-1` — Roll 2d6 and subtract 1

Dice results go to the **Dice** panel, where everyone can see them. It keeps a
running list of the rolls, oldest at the top and newest at the bottom, and it
follows along as they come in unless you have scrolled up to read something
earlier. The list survives a refresh.

**Secret rolls.** Tick **Secret Roll** before rolling and the other players
never see it. Your DM does — deliberately, so they can settle an argument about
what was really rolled — and the checkbox says so. Your own secret rolls stay in
your list marked **🔒 Secret**, so you can look back at them; the **Secret**
button at the top of the panel hides them from your own view if you would rather
keep the list to open rolls, which changes nothing for anyone else.

### Your Own Notes

The **Notes** tab is yours alone. Keep as many as you like for each campaign — a
plan for next session, what the party has worked out about the villain, a
running list of who owes whom money.

Notes are written in **Markdown**, so headings, lists, bold, quotes and links
all work, and the eye button switches to a laid-out preview. Pick between them
from the dropdown, and **+** starts a new one. They save themselves a moment
after you stop typing; the line underneath tells you whether everything is
saved.

**These are private.** Nobody else can read them — your DM included. That is
enforced by the server, not just hidden in the page. A single note can run to
100,000 characters, roughly fifty printed pages.

### Past Sessions

The **Session** tab has a **Past Sessions** list: every finished session,
newest first, with its date, how long you played, and whatever the DM wrote
about it when they ended it. It is the thing to read before the next game.

Everyone in the campaign sees the same list. A session the DM wrote nothing for
still appears, marked as having no notes.

### Moving Your Token

When the DM has placed your character's token on the map and the session is live, you can **drag it** to move around. Just click and drag to your destination.

*GIF pending — Moving a player token.*

Token movement is broadcast to everyone in real time — your party can watch you walk into that very suspicious hallway.

> **Note:** Token movement is disabled when the session is paused.

### The Vibe Tracker

The **Vibe Tracker** is a mood indicator that the DM sets to communicate the current atmosphere of the scene. It might say things like "Cozy," "Tense," "Mysterious," or "Triumphant."

Keep an eye on it — it's your DM's way of setting the tone without breaking the narrative.

*Screenshot pending — Vibe tracker showing different states.*

### The Initiative Tracker

When combat starts, the **Initiative Tracker** appears (or is revealed by the DM) on the right sidebar. It shows the current turn order, who's active, and HP for each combatant.

*Screenshot pending — Initiative tracker panel during combat.*

During your turn, you'll see your name highlighted. Use your token to move and the chat to narrate your actions!

Whoever's turn it is also gets a pulsing gold ring around their token on the map, so it's clear which creature is acting even when several look alike. Hovering a name in the tracker outlines that token on the map, and hovering a token on the map tints its row in the list.

---

## Advanced Features

### Session State Saving

CozyVTT automatically saves session state — token positions, chat history, and initiative order are preserved between sessions. When you come back, everything is right where you left it.

The DM can also manually trigger a save or end the session, which locks in the current state.

### Multi-Map Support

A campaign can have multiple maps loaded at once. The DM can switch the active map at any time, and all players are taken to the new map immediately. Great for transitions between locations without stopping the action.

*GIF pending — DM switching maps mid-session.*

### The Spirit Layer

The Spirit Layer is a second plane for the map, used for games where some characters can perceive things others can't — astral space, the ethereal plane, the spirit world. It is a separate plane rather than a see-through overlay: a player viewing the spirit realm sees the tokens on that plane instead of the ordinary ones, including instead of their own. The DM chooses which tokens live on it, who can see it, and the visual style.

If you are a player and the map has gone dark or your token has vanished, ask your DM whether the Spirit Layer is switched on — see [The Spirit Layer](DM_GUIDE.md#the-spirit-layer) in the DM guide.

*Screenshot pending — Map with spirit layer overlay.*

### Ambient Atmosphere

DMs can set ambient audio tracks and visual atmosphere effects from the Atmosphere panel. Six visual overlays are available — rain, mist, leaves, sparkles, snow, and wind. Players hear the audio and see the visual effects automatically when connected to an active session.

*Screenshot pending — Atmosphere controls panel.*

### Dynamic Lighting

When a DM enables dynamic lighting on a map, players only see what their token can. Light sources placed by the DM have two radii:

- **Bright radius** — full visibility, strong glow (e.g. the inner 20 ft of a torch)
- **Dim radius** — reduced visibility with a fainter glow (e.g. the outer 20 ft of a torch)

Where two dim light zones overlap, the area is treated as bright light. This matches the light rules in D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2e, and most other TTRPG systems.

**Light does not see for you.** A lit area is only visible to you if your token
could actually see it — walls block sight as well as light, so a lamp burning
inside a closed room shows you nothing from outside it, and the creatures in
there stay hidden until you can see in. Your token's **sight radius** governs how
far you make things out in the dark; it does not stop you noticing a lit room
across a courtyard once you have a clear line to it.

*Screenshot pending — Map with dynamic lighting and bright/dim zones.*

### Appearance & Theming

CozyVTT theming works in two layers:

**Per-user (every account)** — From your **Profile** page you pick the theme and font *you* want to see when you're logged in. Your choice is saved to your account and persists across logout/login. See the [Your Profile → Themes](#themes--fonts) section below.

**Instance default (admin only)** — Platform administrators set the default theme used on the login page and applied to brand-new users until they pick their own. Configured under **Admin Panel → Appearance**:

- **Default theme** — 16 built-in themes spanning warm, cool, dark, neutral, and vibrant palettes
- **Default font** — 8 open-source font families (Quicksand + Inter default, plus medieval, elegant, handwritten, etc.)
- **Custom theme builder** — primary, accent, background, and text colors; complementary shades derived automatically. The picker shows a live **Readability** check with the contrast ratio of each key text/background pair, flagging anything below the 4.5:1 minimum, and CozyVTT adjusts text shades automatically where it can
Changes preview live as you configure them.

**Custom branding (logo, mascot, favicon)** is not part of the Appearance panel yet. The instance
already honours custom images — they appear on the login page and across the app, system-wide
regardless of each user's theme — but there is no upload screen, so a self-hoster sets them one of
two ways:

- **Replace the default images** in `frontend/public/` (`default-logo.png`, `default-mascot.png`,
  `favicon-32.png`, `favicon-192.png`) and rebuild, or
- **Point the instance at hosted images** by sending `customLogoUrl`, `customMascotUrl` and
  `customFaviconUrl` to `PUT /api/admin/settings` as URLs

An admin upload UI is on the roadmap — see [Future Features](FUTURE_FEATURES.md).

## Your Profile

Click your display name or avatar in the top navigation to reach your **Profile** page.

*Screenshot pending — Profile page.*

### Updating Your Profile

Click **Edit** next to your display name or bio to change them. Click **Save** when you're done.

**Uploading an Avatar:**
Click on your current avatar (or the placeholder) to open the avatar uploader. Choose an image file, then use the crop tool to frame it perfectly. The zoom slider lets you dial in exactly the right framing. Click **Upload** to save.

*GIF pending — Avatar crop and upload flow.*

### Changing Your Password

In the **Security** section, enter your current password and your new password (twice, to confirm), then click **Save**.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

For extra account security, enable **MFA** in the Security section. You'll use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password) to scan a QR code. After that, every login will ask for a one-time code.

You'll also receive a set of **backup codes** when you set up MFA — store these somewhere safe. They're your lifeline if you lose access to your authenticator app.

### Themes & Fonts

From the **Themes** section of your profile, pick the color theme and font *you* want to see across the app:

- Browse 16 built-in themes across light, warm, cool, dark, neutral, and vibrant categories
- Pick from 8 open-source font families
- Or click **Custom** to dial in your own primary / accent / background / text colors

Your choice is saved to your account and applies immediately. It also persists across logout — when you log back in, your theme is restored. Unauthenticated visitors and brand-new users see whatever theme the platform admin has set as the instance default.

### Signing Out

Click **Sign Out** in the Danger Zone section (or from the header menu) to log out.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### I can't connect to my campaign

- Check that you have an active internet connection
- Make sure the DM has started a session (you'll see a "Live" indicator in the header when a session is active)
- Try refreshing the page — CozyVTT will reconnect automatically
- If the problem persists, check with your platform administrator that the server is running

### My token disappeared from the map

Token placement is managed by the DM. If your token isn't on the map, ask your DM to place it. Character assignment to a campaign must happen before a token can be placed.

### I can't see the maps or my character sheet is blank

This is usually a loading issue. Refresh the page. If the problem persists, check the Asset Library to make sure the map image was uploaded correctly.

### I lost connection mid-session

CozyVTT will automatically try to reconnect if you lose connection briefly. Your session state (token positions, chat, etc.) is preserved. If reconnection fails, refresh the page — everything should be right where you left it.

### Someone else is editing my character

Only you (the character owner) and the DM of an assigned campaign can edit a character. If you think someone else has access they shouldn't, contact your platform administrator.

### My dice rolls aren't showing up

Rolls appear in the **Dice** panel, the tab beside Chat — not in the conversation itself. If the panel is empty, make sure the session is active (you see the "Live" indicator): rolls need a live connection to the campaign. If you're not on the campaign page, navigate there first.

### How do I change my email address?

Email addresses cannot be changed by users directly. Contact your platform administrator — they can update it from the Admin Panel.

### How do I delete my account?

Go to your **Profile** page and scroll to the **Danger Zone** section. Click **Delete Account**, type `DELETE` to confirm, and enter your password. This is permanent and will remove all your campaigns, characters, and messages.

> **Warning:** If you're a DM running active campaigns, deleting your account will also remove those campaigns for all players. Make sure to hand off or wrap up campaigns before deleting.

### I forgot my password

Contact your platform administrator. They can reset your password from the Admin Panel and give you a temporary password to log in with.
