# Contributing to CozyVTT

Thank you for your interest! CozyVTT is built with a very specific, "comfy" vision in mind. As the sole maintainer balancing this with limited hobby time, I have to be protective of the codebase and the project's direction.

**I am not accepting unsolicited ("cold") Pull Requests at this time.**

## How to Get Involved

### 🐞 Open an Issue

Found a bug or have a feature request? Opening an issue is the best place to start. Let's discuss the "why" and "how" there first before any code is written.

When reporting a bug, please include:
- CozyVTT version (or git commit hash)
- Browser and OS
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Console output or screenshots if relevant

### 🤝 Become a Collaborator

If you're a developer who wants to help build the official version of CozyVTT, I'd love to meet you. I prefer to get to know my collaborators so we can stay aligned on the project's aesthetic and architecture.

1. Reach out via the [Contact Form](https://cozyvtt.com/Tend-the-Fire/)
2. We'll chat, maybe jump on a call, and see if we're a good fit for working together

### 🍴 Fork It

Since CozyVTT is licensed under the **AGPLv3**, you are always free — and encouraged — to fork the repository, experiment with your own ideas, and host your own modified versions for your friends and community.

## Development Standards

If you become a collaborator, here's what the codebase expects:

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript strict mode** — no implicit nulls, and **no `any`**. This is not a
  style preference: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is an *error* in both
  packages, so a diff containing one will not lint. Reach for `unknown` and a
  narrowing helper instead — `frontend/src/utils/errors.ts` and
  `backend/src/utils/prisma-json.ts` cover the two common cases
- **Tests** — new features should include tests; bug fixes should include a regression test that fails before the fix
- **No new linter warnings** — `npm run lint` must pass cleanly in **both** `backend/` and `frontend/`; both run with `--max-warnings 0`
- **Run every gate, not a subset** — typecheck, lint, both test suites, the frontend build, and the two documentation checks. The full list is in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#everything-before-you-call-something-done), and CI runs the same commands
- **Documentation is part of the change** — if you alter a route, an event, a sheet field or anything a user sees, update the affected document in the same commit

### Security

- Never log sensitive data (passwords, session tokens, full `DATABASE_URL`)
- All authorization checks happen server-side — never trust the client
- File uploads must go through the existing magic byte validation middleware
- Any new WebSocket events that modify state must verify campaign membership server-side

### Styling and themes

CozyVTT ships 16 themes, including four dark ones, plus user-defined custom colors. Two rules keep
every screen working across all of them — both are enforced by tests, so breaking them fails the
build rather than showing up as an unreadable screen for someone using a theme you didn't try:

- **Never use a raw Tailwind palette color** (`bg-red-50`, `text-stone-500`, `text-blue-600`) in
  themed UI. They keep their light-mode appearance on dark themes. Use the semantic tokens —
  `danger`, `success`, `warning`, `info`, `spirit` — or the `.alert-*` and `.badge-*` classes in
  `frontend/src/index.css`.
- **Use the `-ink` variant when the color is text**: `text-danger-ink`, not `text-danger`;
  `text-brand-ink`, not `text-moss-green`. The plain token is a fill (buttons, borders, tints); the
  `-ink` version is derived per theme to stay above WCAG AA against that theme's backgrounds.

Two areas are deliberately exempt and listed in `utils/__tests__/themeTokens.test.ts`: the character
sheets (styled as light "paper" cards, matching the physical sheets) and the dark DM overlays that
float over the map. If you add UI there, check its contrast by hand — exempt from theming is not
exempt from being readable.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md → Theming](ARCHITECTURE.md#theming) for the full token list.

### Performance

- Avoid blocking the event loop in route handlers — use `async/await` with Prisma
- Map/token updates should be debounced or throttled where appropriate (follow existing patterns)
- New React components should avoid unnecessary re-renders; use `useMemo`/`useCallback` where it matters

### Adding a New Game System

Adding a new tabletop game system is one of the most valuable contributions. Follow the step-by-step guide in [docs/GAME_SYSTEMS.md](GAME_SYSTEMS.md) — it covers every file you need to create and how they fit together.
