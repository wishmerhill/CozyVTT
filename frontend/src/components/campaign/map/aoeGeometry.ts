/**
 * aoeGeometry.ts
 * Grid snapping for area-of-effect templates.
 *
 * AoE shapes used to be anchored at the *centre of the hovered square*, so a
 * 10 ft cube on a 5 ft grid — exactly two squares across — straddled four
 * squares by half a square in each direction instead of covering two cleanly.
 * The same offset skewed lines and cones.
 *
 * The rule that fixes it is the parity rule familiar from grid play: a span an
 * **even** number of squares wide has its edges on grid lines when it is
 * centred on a grid *intersection*, and an **odd** span does when it is centred
 * on a square *centre*. Snapping each axis by the parity of the span across it
 * puts every edge on a grid line.
 *
 * Cones and lines need a second thing the parity rule cannot give them: they are
 * *aimed*, so they need a point to emerge from as well as a square to sit in.
 * That is `squareExitPoint`, and the rule there is that the origin must be a
 * **continuous** function of the anchor and the aim — see its comment for why
 * anything that classifies the angle into sectors is wrong.
 *
 * All coordinates here are **map pixels with a top-left origin**, matching
 * coords.ts — grid lines fall on exact multiples of `gridSize`, so no
 * bottom-left flip is involved.

 * Where a ray leaving the centre of a square crosses that square's edge.

 * be picked by classifying the angle into one of eight 45° sectors and snapping
 * each axis to a grid line or a square centre, so rotating a template made the
 * origin teleport between a handful of fixed spots instead of sweeping around
 * the square. Worse, the snap was direction-blind — aiming left and aiming
 * right produced the same point, so a leftward cone emerged from the right edge
 * and cut back through the caster.
 *
 * Aimed along an axis the ray lands on the midpoint of that edge; aimed exactly
 * diagonally it lands on the corner. Both fall out of the maths, so neither is
 * special-cased and there is no sector boundary to jump across.
 *
