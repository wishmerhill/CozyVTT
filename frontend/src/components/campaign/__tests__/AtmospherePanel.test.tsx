/**
 * Which tracks the atmosphere panel offers.
 *
 * The asset list a DM can see is wider than the set they may actually play:
 * it also holds audio scoped to other campaigns they belong to, which the
 * server refuses because a track belongs to the table it was uploaded for.
 * Offering one of those produced a button that silently did nothing, since a
 * refused set only reaches the console.
 *
 * The scope line had the same shape of bug: a two-way label that called every
 * non-campaign track "Global", so a DM's own personal track was described as
 * something the whole instance could see.
