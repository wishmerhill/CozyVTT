// Asset URL helpers
//
// Asset references are stored in one of two shapes depending on how old the
// record is and which route wrote it:
//
//   "/api/assets/tokens/{uuid}"   the canonical form (see backend
//                                 utils/asset-urls.ts, which normalises on
//                                 write for characters, maps and tokens)
//   "{uuid}"                      a bare id, written by older paths
//
// Anything reading a stored reference has to cope with both, so the
// extraction lives here rather than being re-derived per component.
