/**
 * Theme Token Guard
 *
 * Raw Tailwind palette colors (bg-red-50, text-stone-500, …) do not follow the
 * theme: an error box built from them stays pale pink on a dark theme, and grey
 * text keeps its light-mode shade on a dark panel. Every themed surface must use
 * the semantic tokens instead — see the alert and badge classes in index.css,
 * and the token list in tailwind.config.js.
 *
 * Two areas are deliberately exempt because they are fixed-surface designs
 * rather than themed UI, and are listed explicitly so the exemption stays
 * visible and reviewable.
